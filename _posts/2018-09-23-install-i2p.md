The I2P service is pretty simple to install, simply use the `apt` repository

#### Gather the binaries

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:i2p-maintainers/i2p
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install i2p
```

Once installed we can ensure it is running...
```bash
systemctl status i2p.service
```

#### Basic config tweeks

Assuming that worked, first thing we will want to do is to familiarize ourselves with the router config.  The preferred way to do this is through the router console served on localhost.  Since our VM is tiny and we have not installed a desktop thus far, we will do this through lynx (or dillo or seamonkey)

```bash
# Pick the browser you want...
# browser="seamonkey"
# browser="dillo"
browser="lynx -cookies"
http_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:4444" \
 no_proxy="127.0.0.1" \
 $browser \
 http://127.0.0.1:7657
```

First thing I did was to lower the bandwidth by a factor of 3.  Since GCE charges for `egress` (bytes in) you will want to keep track of this and not go overboard.  This can be done manually in `/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/router.config`, or at the URI `http://127.0.0.1:7657`

Next I changed I2P to point to my existing `lighttpd` server instead of spinning up the default `Jetty` webserver.  First find out what `clientApp` is associated with `jetty`

```bash
sudo egrep "main=.*jetty" /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/clients.config
# yields clientApp.3.main=net.i2p.jetty.JettyStart
```

So, Jetty settings are in `clientApp` number `3`.  Now to prevent Jetty from loading we change its `startOnLoad` to `false`

```bash
sudo vi /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/clients.config
  clientApp.3.startOnLoad=false # find this line and set it accordingly
```

Now, without jetty, we will want to to change target port the tunnel is using to `80` since that is where our webserver is serving.

Find the tunnel using port `7658` (the default jetty port)

```bash
grep 7658 /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/i2ptunnel.config
# yields tunnel.3.targetPort=7658
```

So in this test config, our eepsite is described in tunnel `3`

```bash
sudo vi /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/i2ptunnel.config
  tunnel.3.targetPort=80 # find this line and set it accordingly
```

#### Open Firewall

Finally, once everything is set up, we can open up our incoming ports to participate fully in the network.  First determine what port to open
```bash
sudo grep -i port /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/router.config
```

Although it isn't clear from the config file, I2P opens both TCP and UDP ports.  You need to enable both.  See `http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet` for more info.

Create a firewall in GCP for our VM to use that port.
```bash
gcloud config set compute/zone {zone}
gcloud compute firewall-rules create i2p-server \
 --target-tags=i2p-server \
 --allow=udp:{port},tcp:{port} \
 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0
gcloud compute instances add-tags {vm-name} --tags "i2p-server"
```

#### Handle hosts file

At this point the [lighttpd server]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-22-install-lighttpd %}) is serving up content for both our clearnet webstie and our i2p site (eepsite).  The eepsite has one extra requirement which is a `hosts.txt` file.  Usually it is served out of the `jetty` site, but since we are not using that, we will just make a symlink to the appropriate file.  But we will want to ensure we set the permissions appropriately.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop lighttpd.service
sudo systemctl stop i2p.service
sudo chown i2psvc:www-data ~i2psvc/i2p-config/eepsite/docroot/hosts.txt
sudo ln -s ~i2psvc/i2p-config/eepsite/docroot/hosts.txt ~www-data/html/hosts.txt
sudo systemctl start lighttpd.service
sudo systemctl start i2p.service
```

Of course we will want to change our [sitebuild.sh]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-22-install-lighttpd %}) file as well to read
```bash
#!/bin/bash
docroot="~www-data/html"
sudo -- sh -c "umask 0027; bundle exec jekyll build -d $docroot"
sudo chown -R root:www-data $docroot
sudo chmod -R g+r,o-rwx,g-w $docroot
sudo ln -s ~i2psvc/i2p-config/eepsite/docroot/hosts.txt ~www-data/html/hosts.txt
sudo chown i2psvc:www-data ${docroot}/hosts.txt
```

#### Final config tweeks

Finally, if you [installed seamonkey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-21-create-gce-vm %}) in the VM, you can finish the I2P configuration via VNC with the following `xterm` command
```bash
http_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:4444" \
 no_proxy="127.0.0.1" \
 seamonkey http://127.0.0.1:7657
```

From within Seamonkey...

* Click 'Router Console'
* Click 'Hidden Service Manager'
* Click 'Start' for the HTTP Server
* Click the config gear next to your I2P HTTP Server
* Fill out Name, Description, and pick a '.i2p' hostname
* Check 'Automatically start tunnel ...'
* Click 'Save'
* Click the config gear next to your I2P HTTP Server (again)
* Click 'Add to local addressbook'
* Click 'Replace'
* Click Back navigation
* Click 'Add to local addressbook' (again)
* Click 'Published' (If you want to publish)
* Click 'Replace' (If you want to publish)
* Exit seamonkey
* `vncserver -kill :1` to stop VNC
