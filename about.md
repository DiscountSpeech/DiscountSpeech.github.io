This site is an attempt to educate myself on aspects of hosting content on [darknet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet) services.  Most of this content is not anonomized or intended to hide my identity, but rather to enhance my ability to speak freely.  I do not believe that our society is failing or faultering, but am aware enough to know that some speech is becoming less and less accepted. 

This site was created with Jekyll with **minimal** WebDev experience.  For more information: [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
